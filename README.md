Introduction 

A Dual Fan Interlocking System is a control mechanism designed to manage the operation of two fans in a coordinated manner. This system is widely used in applications where continuous airflow is critical, such as in data centers, HVAC systems, industrial machinery, and electronic enclosures. In a dual fan system with separate operation, two fans work independently, each controlled by its own On/Off switch. One of the fans acts as an intake fan (pushing air into the system), while the other acts as an exhaust fan (pulling air out of the system). This configuration ensures controlled airflow direction, pressure balance, and efficient heat dissipation or ventilation. 

System Overview 

Fan 1 (Intake Fan): Pushes fresh air into the system. 

Fan 2 (Exhaust Fan): Pulls stale or hot air out of the system. 

Control Mechanism: Each fan is controlled by its own On/Off switch, allowing independent operation. 

Airflow Direction: The system creates a unidirectional airflow path, ensuring efficient cooling or ventilation. 

Key Features 

Independent Control: Each fan can be turned on or off independently, providing flexibility in operation. 

Directional Airflow: One fan pushes air in, while the other pulls air out, creating a controlled airflow path. 

Pressure Management: The system maintains a balance between intake and exhaust airflow to avoid over-pressurization or under-pressurization. 

Energy Efficiency: Fans can be operated only when needed, reducing energy consumption. 

Working Principle 

The ladder program shows the design. Each of the fans has 2 different Normally Open switches (one works in reverse manner), a latch switch, and Normally Closed switches attached on each line linked to the opposite fans. 

Normal Operation: 

Fan 1 (Intake): Turned On to push fresh air into the system. 

Fan 2 (Exhaust): Turned On to pull stale or hot air out of the system. 

The two fans cannot turn ON the same time 

Independent Operation: 

If only Fan 1 is turned On, the system will push air into the enclosure, increasing internal pressure. 

If only Fan 2 is turned On, the system will pull air out of the enclosure, creating negative pressure. 

Applications 

Electronic Cooling: Used in server racks, control panels, or electronic enclosures to manage heat dissipation. 

Ventilation Systems: Provides fresh air intake and exhaust in buildings, factories, or confined spaces. 

Industrial Processes: Controls airflow in ovens, furnaces, or drying systems. 

Laboratory Fume Hoods: Ensures safe removal of hazardous fumes while maintaining airflow balance.
